2. **Timeline**: Social feed with run posts and events
3. **Run**: Track runs and post results
4. **Profile**: User profile and stats

Each tab can push to detail screens using native stack navigation.

The app includes comprehensive mock data:
- 8 users (including current user)
- 8 organizations (3 partners, 5 community)
